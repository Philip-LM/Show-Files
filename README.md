Heya, Philip here

Here are my actually important show files (mostly for MQ atm but who knows what will end up here, hopefully not eos)
Feel free to take them, just don't expect them to be very good or for me to help you to use them.
If you want to put your own show files on here I guess you could, not a massive portfoliio but hey ho

These are mainly finished up shows, I keep the WIPs on my local drive and a USB stick so only actually finished things should end up here

There isn't really a naming format it's just kinda a random name vaguely related to the show then normally a date at the end of it (in varying formats so take your pick)

Anyways, have fun with the files I guess
